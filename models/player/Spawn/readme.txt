Spawn Half Life Player Model...

A brief explanation...

I don't really know much about the character itself, so I don't suppose I'm the best qualified person to really make the character accurately. Sorry If I've offended any Spawn fans with this model. I Didn't really have much reference material either. I based the model on a friend's action figure, which I believe in turn is based on the movie version of the character. I understand that he has some sort of flamboyant cape that sprouts all kinds of gadgets. I'd have loved to have included this but as I'm still learning the Half Life setup, and as adding the cape, would mean editing all 77 animations for the player model, I decided to stick with just the humanoid form. Besides, the action figure itself didn't have a cape with it. 

The figure itself is 636 triangles which is about a hundred more triangles than I would normally build a figure with but it's all those darn spikes! This means it is most definately a high-poly figure - sorry to all you folk with low-end machines (that includes me).

To install:
Unzip the zipfile into your Sierra/Half-Life/Valve/Models/Player folder
It will automatically create a folder called Spawn and place the mdl and bmp inside it.

This model took me just short of 3 days to make and might have been better with more time but I have other things on the go which require my attention.
