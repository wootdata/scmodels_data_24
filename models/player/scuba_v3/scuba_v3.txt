******SCUBA DIVER******

Wouldn't you want to play as a scuba diver?



--------------------------------------------------
This is my first model submition, although I have 
been working with 3dsmax and Photoshop for many 
years.

My name is Daryl Willms.  I am in grade 11 at 
Robert Bateman Secondary School.  I currently 
have been accepted to work as a animator/modeler 
for a company called AlienTrap.

I made it a Scuba Diver, because frankly I could 
not think of anything else.  It also seemed like 
a challenging model/texture character to make.
