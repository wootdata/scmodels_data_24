From the Author============================================
This is my very first Model. U may be familiar with my RAGE skins (all
skin names end with "RAGE"  EX: AUSTINrage) Well here is my first model,
started from skratch using MILKSHAPE 3D, along with help from SCARECROWS
tutorials at http://www.planethalflife.com/coldfusion/
The cape was harder than u'd think, cause it consist of 2 sides, if u 
only make one u would have been able to see right through from the 
bottom. And also had to get the right face on the right side of the 
cape, Cause if u dont then u end up with black faces all over ur cape.
Oh and wile exporting the .smd i had a Bogus Bone error, this occurs
when u dont have every vertex attached to some bone of ur skeleton.
not only that but each vertex should only be attached to one bone only!
Well, hopefully i heple modelers out there a little, enjoy the model.
