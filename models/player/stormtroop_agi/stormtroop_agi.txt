
			Stormtrooper from Star Wars


Here I go again.

This is my second attempt to create a model. 

Release 1.:
-----------
The facecount. This was my greatest problem when I created the helmet. It's now over 200. For this I must create low-polygon arms and legs. The elbow is very bad at little bending. It looks like very sharp. But the textures are all good (I think...).     (Never released...)

Release 2.: 
-----------
The facecount is higher then the latest one. It's now 920. But almost all of the elbow problems are corrected. I think an error occours: I deleted the faces of the triceps and I added two vertexes and created new faces, but I cannot understand why the facecount grow with 10 because 2 new vertex (in my model) creates 4 new faces, so I thought that the end will 918. And why the vertices count grow with 20 ?????? 

A problem... I designed the model's name to : Stormtrooper_Agi , but at the final testing (with Jumbot) I realized that this name is too long... :-(
I must have truncated it to Stormtroop_Agi.
