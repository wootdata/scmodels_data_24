Description             : Converted Player Model for Half-Life DM

All Credit Due          : to Gabor and MZ.MARS for creating this great Model
=============================================================================

This is converted Counter Strike Hostage Model (one of a complete set).

Basically I updated the animations, but I had to edit some of the mesh to
eliminate some really really weird arm and shoulderblade distortion thingies.

All the compiling and decompiling was done in Milkshape 1.5.10.

The total modification took about 4 hours from start to finish. 

Info:

Files included:
CheckMate.mdl - The HLDM player version of the game CheckMate model file
CheckMate.bmp - The picture you see when selecting the model in the game
CheckMate.txt - This text file

Place CheckMate.mdl, CheckMate.bmp, CheckMate.jpg and CheckMate.txt in a
new folder called CheckMate, in valve\models\player folder in your Half
Life directory.

** IMPORTANT NOTICE **
This model should NOT be distributed in any kind of commercial
compilation, product or package without my personal approval.

This model CAN otherwise be distributed freely as long as this text
file is included, unmodified, with the package.

And PLEASE don't extract the skin and draw a mustache or remove the
clothes from it and release it to the world as yours, don't be lame.
(thanks to NSi for the notice).
